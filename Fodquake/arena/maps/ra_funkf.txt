Description             : Designed for the hectic 1v1 DM variant
                          called "Rocket Arena." Best played under GLQuake.
                          R_SPEEDS under GLQuake are not as good due to
                          the transparent water compilation, but framerates
                          are excellent - your card will take up the slack.
                          Non GL version is not compiled for transparent
                          water and has typically acceptable R_SPEEDS around
                          450 max.
