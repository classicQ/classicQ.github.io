Description             : This is my first attempt at a rocket arena map.  It is 
                          modelled on a tomb/pyramid and was designed with speed and 
                          gameplay in mind.
                          (BTW this may just be entered into the current Rocket 
			  Arena level compo that is going on)
			  After some serious :) playtesting I decided to replace
			  the cage with glass (Thanx to Rorshach for showing me how
			  bloody simple glass is (and makin me kick myself!))

Additional Credits to   : [OCR]Slop (#Quake.ger on IRCnet Demon) for putting it on a RA server
			  Catfood for keeping mine (& every1 else's) mothers happy :)
			  Gumby for being a fat bastard
			  Claire (AKA Mad Moose) for wingin my fucking head off
			  Rorshach for inspiring me into this mush in the first place
			  My bloody PC that terminated my TF project so I could do this
			  Gunhed for GLQuake testing it at short notice
			  Lukas.buck[iC] for havin a peep at it		
			  GuruMauve for giving me a LPB beating on it :(			  
			  [GOC]Joker for speaking anal english while testing the map with me

Whats to come next	: I have 4 more maps planed
			  They r as follows
				Hells basin (A hellish theme)
				Outta this world (A low G arena set in space)
				The crypt (A medievel sorta slant) (May be canned)
				Nature's Way (Set in a forest)  
			  
			  I have also started work on a taster level for a new conversion I have
			  planned called Sole survivor.  It is already looking quite nice and 
			  will probably be released during the middle of next month.
			  Give me some views and if the response is good enough then I will do
			  A conversion around it :)
