Unholy Chapel - By Spanky
----------------------

This is my first atempt at making a Rocket Arena level.  I tried
to make it look good with some solids and lightings.  I added some 
tourches and some lava (can't fall in it) to enhance the viewing of
the level.  

I made the teleport destinations in the arena part and named them
"join", if that is at any importance.  

Hopefully you will actually publish this map and make it sucessful!
That would make me feel good :)

If this level is successful and demand is high, I will make more levels,
for arena and deathmatch, possibly Teamfortress.
