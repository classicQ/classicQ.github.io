Description                 : A Rocket Arena Map, has 2 castle type things on either end 
                              of a wide open courtyard.  There is a small lake type thing
                              in the middle of the courtyard, and on either end of that
                              there are little cave things with teleports that lead to
                              the towers.  There are bridges on either side that will take
                              you from base to base.  There is some little sniping platforms 
                              in the middle too.

Additional Credits          : ID, for Quake and some other people i am forgetting, hehe
