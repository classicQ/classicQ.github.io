Title                   : Reduced Gravity
Filename                : LowGrav.BSP
Version                 : 12/1/97

Note: THIS MAP WAS DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED WITH SV_GRAVITY SET TO 150,
it can be played with the default 800, but it's not as fun.

Description             : This a slight departure from most other RA maps,
			  It's a medium sized round room with platforms at
			  various hieghts around the sides. It was meant to
			  be played with a low SV_GRAVITY, I think 150 is
			  probably the best value I have found.

Additional Credits to   : id for quake (soon to be Quake2);
			  crt for Rocket Arena, on of the best mods ever;
			  Pastry God, Darx, FunkyT and friends, for play testing
			  Efnet #quake for being Efnet #quake (Wouldn't want to
			  waste long periods of time anywhere else)
