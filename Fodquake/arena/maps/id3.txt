Description               : MultiArena Map

                            This is my contribution to the MultiArena mod
                            (www.planetquake.com/servers/arena)

                            It consists of 3 "classic" rooms from the original
                            id levels: E1M5's RL room, DM3's RL room, and DM6's
                            RA room + plus the first room from the 'start' map.
