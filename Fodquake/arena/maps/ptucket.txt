Other Info

Map Making history      : This is my second Rocket Arena map.  
                          I have started a ton of maps, and am
                          currently making some sets for an
                          upcomming Phantasm movie.

Worst known R_SPEEDS    : 771  :o  That sucks, but there is not much
                          that I can do, given the desired design.
                          Alot of the map is in the 500s-600s, which is
                          pretty bad in its own right.

About the name          : It is named for a local area (my hometown, actually)
                          here in Rhode Island, which is also an Indian 
                          word probably in the tongue of the Naragansetts.
                          Pawtucket is home of the AAA Red Sox, the first
                          mill in the new world (Slater Mill), and the most
                          hideous s-curves you will ever see on an interstate
                          anywhere in the country.  As far as I know, there
                          is no current Pawtucket Palladium: it just 
                          sounded good to me.

Lessons Learned         : I've been wrestling with octagonal shapes for a
                          while now and I think I've finally gotten it
                          under control.  The trick is to make sure every
                          single vertex sits on on the grid.  This means that
                          you cannot make a "true" hexagon, as an integer number
                          of units in one dimmension leads you too a decimal
                          number of units in another.  My advice: use the
                          old 13-12-5 triangle as a guide.  It is close enough.
                          I used it at some "radius" distance, but then chose
                          to extend from there using 2-to-1 unit lines (slopes
                          of 2 or 0.5), which isn't even the 12-5 that I just 
                          suggested, let alone not being true to octagonal types
                          of lines, but is good enough for short spans.  I
                          extended these lines too far towards the middle, which
                          resulted in the very non-octagonal shape of the roof
                          opening.  I decided, though, that I liked the way it
                          had turned out anyway, and kept it as is.  

                          God bless vertex manipulation.  :-)

Additional Credits      : I just wanted to tip my hat again to the RA team,
                          as well as the authors of the first sets of maps.
                          As it happened with CTF, I'm sure that the all of the 
                          next generation of RA maps will be inspired by one
                          or more of the original RA maps.  I was inspired by the
                          set as a whole - trying to make a good stadium type of
                          arena, as most in the original set are, as opposed to 
                          more of a mini-dm-level type, of which there are a few.
