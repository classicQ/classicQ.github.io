Description                 : A Rocket Arena, based on a Playground, simple but fun.
			      With a lame excuse for a spectator area. Oh well, one must decide 
			      between appearance and performance. Having a p90 i choose                               performance. Hope someone enjoys this...

Additional Credits          : ID, for Quake and all the people who made Rocket Arena possible. 			              And to Ben Morris for the best Quake Level editor out there.
			      And everyone else I am too tired to think of.
