Description             : This is my contribution to the Rocket Arena mod                         
                          (http://www.planetquake.com/servers/arena)                       
                          And unlike most other levels I have seen this is
                          a real arena, resembling the "Colloseum" in
                          ancient rome.
                          It is quite simple - I would have loved to add
                          more detail, but this is for 1on1 fights and
                          should run as smoothly as possible. I'm sure
                          you'll like it anyway :)

                          I'd like to encourage everybody to run this level
                          on as many servers as possible, please contact me
                          so I can compile a list (which can be found on my
                          homepage).
