Description             : 

A small rocket arena map set on a ski slope. The entire map is slanted at 10 degrees
to the horizontal. Combat terrain consists of 2 fairly large "bumps", and 2 ledges
(access provided by 2 nearby teleporters).

Playing on a map slanted at an angle is an entirely new experience. :)

New textures used are from the Axl texture wads (by @xl Kawa).

This is a level for Expert Quake.  http://www.planetquake.com/expert/
