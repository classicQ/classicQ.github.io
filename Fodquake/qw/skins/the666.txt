Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
This is the Clan 666! skin for the player.mdl
I basically altered the Quake player model skin
to get this.  After I changed the pad and body
colors, I added the pentagram to the chest in full
bright red colors.  The numbers were added to the gun
and back in full bright yellow.  The arm textures
came from some strange furry-looking texture I made
with Photoshop, and I just slapped them on to see
what they would look like, and the 666! liked it.
The face was turned to stone, and the helmet was fixed a bit,
I randomly came up with the evil grin by messing with the
full bright reds.  The gun had the numbers added and the
axe was electroplated with a little gold.


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Create a directory in your Quake directory (eg:666) and unzip 
the archive in it.  Run quake with the -game parameter, eg:

quake -game 666
