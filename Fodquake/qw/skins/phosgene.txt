Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
This is the Clan PhosGene skin for the player.mdl
I did quite an overhaul to the old skin.  I touched
up the arms so the colors are better, I added the
camoflauge pants, I increased the size of the logo
and added the letters, and I changed the pads a bit.
The arms, one color of the pants camo and 
logo change to the quake pants color,
The pads change to the quake shirt color.
The boots and gloves were made black, and spikes
were added to the outside of the gloves.
I drew the axe almost from scratch.  I used a texture
I found on another mdl from Quake for the axeblade,
and modified it a bit, but the rest is new. I added a
few highlights to the gun, made a green "window"
like area on both sides, and added the green bore.



How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------

Create a directory in your Quake directory (eg:phosgene) and unzip 
the archive in it.  Run quake with the -game parameter, eg:
