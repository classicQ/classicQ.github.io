These locs were made by flintheart originally for Fuhquake. They work with most clients, including EZQuake - but not mQWCL.

Put these locs in qw/locs.  These locs let you customise various names of items on locs,
but first you need to set the names like this:

set loc_name_ra "ra"
set loc_name_ya "ya"
set loc_name_ga "ga"
set loc_name_mh "mega"			
set loc_name_separator "-" 		(eg "bridge-high", "bridge/high" or "bridge$.high" etc)
set loc_name_quad "quad"
set loc_name_ring "ring"
set loc_name_pent "pent"
set loc_name_suit "suit"

If you don't like "ra" you can change it to "RA", "$2$0$0" (gold numbers),
"200", or whatever else you want. With EZQuake you can use ascii-codes to change the color of the various items.
The same goes for ya/ga/mh/separator/quad/ring/pent/suit.

Note that these names of the items shown here are pre-set. If you want to change them you'll have to do it your self in your playerconfig.

MESSAGE FROM FLINTHEART
-----------------------

Hello! - last updated 2007-11-05

Latest changes:
* Added $loc_name_quad/pent/ring/bio so that you can edit those yourself if you want to
* Added locs for Kenya 2on2-tourney, slight modifications on vendm3 (didn't see the ring! haha)
* Added dspdm3.loc, dspdm4.loc, dakdm4b.loc and enraged.loc

Coming locs:
* you tell me :)

Feel free to comment the locs - suggestions, bugreports, critics etc. Please spread them out. 
All the locs I have done, are actually made with [NF]Proxy (!), and edited with EditPlus.
There should be 185 locfiles in this zip file.

Credits goes to the very eminent qw-clans Flaming Fist, Lege Artis, Lithium and Slackers for inspiration of the marking-layout :) 
And also to Interceptor for some help!

Have Fun!
flintheart, #freedom @ QuakeNet
