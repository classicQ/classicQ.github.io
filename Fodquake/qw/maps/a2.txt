Reason for Living
[===============]

Everyone seems to like the texture set I used for dayDream, so decided to use it for
a fully fledged 'grown up' map.  This one's designed for 2v2, but also provides a damn
fine duel as well.

So, go look around.  As this is probably my last Q1 level I've tried to show off as
much as I possibly can, by also push the old Q engine as far as it will go.  With 
FOV set at 110 the polys pop up to 700 here and there, but are usually below 600.
If you play in higher than FOV 110 then you also probably in software with it looking
like lego on speed, so the extra 50 polys won't matter to you.... I hope #8¬)

Textures Used
[===========]

Not quite sure where all of these textures are from, but several
are definitely from the original Arena pak, some from quake itself,
one from Rubicon, a top single player pak by John Fitzgibbons
(I've used his textures before and forgot to mention him so hope
this makes up for it - johnfitz@u.washington.edu).

Also the long picture in the main room is from the artworks.wad,
created by Sonya Roberts - sonya_roberts@geocities.com.

The rest... gawd knows; If you spot your texture then I thank you
for letting me use it..

Enjoy.. Pingu MCMXCIX
