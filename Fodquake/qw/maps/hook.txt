You have to:
1. Unzip hook[se,sew].bsp into ../quake/id1/maps directory.
2. Run Quake. [GLQuake is preferrable]
3. In Quake, at the console type "map hook[se;sew]".
4. Play the map.
5. Enjoy it or hate it.
6. Exit the game.
7. Launch your mail program.
8. Write love/hate mail to vondur@planetquake.com.
Just eight points. Easy, huh?

This level designed for 1-on-1 game. 4ffa must work too. But, as 
for 6ffa...I just don't know, sorry.

              !!! ATTENTION, OMICRON BOT LOVERS !!!

I've made separate version of this map for omis because of:
1. They can't reach hanging rocketlauncher or do it silly
2. They scared a bit by the air lifts
Besides,  some  human  players might be unhappy with this things 
too.

Therefore,  if  you  want  to  try another way to kill, just use
either  hookse.bsp  or hooksew.bsp [with built-in waypoints] map
instead of original hook.bsp.

Changes in hookse.bsp:
1. Hanging RL placed on special bridge
2. Air lifts changed to mechanic ones
3. Secret door health decreased from 200 to 20

CAUTION: If you'll try  to launch hooksew.bsp in original  Quake 
you'll  receive  bunch of error messages, but map will run after
this though. 

                    иии END OF ATTENTION иии

By  entering  into  the level type at the console "notarget". It 
requires for Enforcer, guide dude, who walks on the base useless.
If you will not type "notarget" he will very annoyed and conflict
will be inevitable. "Notarget" is just ticket. He will guide you
through the base and will show you all the rooms. Don't forget to 
say him thanks. He works for free....
