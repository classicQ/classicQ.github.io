==================================================

* How to speed up the game *

Though this map runs pretty fast (the max number of surfaces that quake
has to display from the *worst* point of view is about 460 and the
average one is about 250/300) i added a quite big amount of torches
which tend to slow down the game especially for those who are stucked with
a poor P100 with 16 megs as i'm. Torches look good but don't add
anything to the gameplay so if you like you can remove them all in this way:
i) get a copy of QBSP
ii) Put QBSP, debello.bsp and debello.map under the same dir
iii) Run a dos-prompt and type: qbsp -onlyents debello
That's all

* Other Works (avalaible on the CDROM site, thanx Joost) *

"The Blue Death"
ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/levels/deathmatch/a-c/bdeath.zip
It's a small level made for those who love the good old SSG

"UltraViolence"
ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/levels/deathmatch/s-u/ultrav.zip
Another small deadly map made for a very intensive DM.
It's a sort of heaven if you like to rocket-jump on your buddy's head.

"Razzi Amari"
ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/levels/deathmatch/p-r/razzi.zip
Medium size map suitable for 6-8 players. It's a "metal"
DM level very interconnected for allowing a very fast gameplay.
If you love classics then give it a run through.

Comments, suggestions and/or REQs are welcome.
Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.
