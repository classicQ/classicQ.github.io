 Description:

    Here's the long awaited first official Slide level pak. It includes nine
 all-new Slide levels as well as a new Slide start map. All you do to get it
 to run, is copy the pak1.pak file into your Slide directory that already
 has the pak0.pak file in it. Then run off and play your levels. :)

 Misc:
 ------
 The start level isn't all that great, but that's cause our real start level
 fell through at the last moment, and I (SiNGE) had to whip up a start level
 real quick from scratch in one day. Believe me, it shows. :)
