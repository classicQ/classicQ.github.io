			  The people who played spine during the Qonference '98
			  and gave me valubale feedback and suggstions for improvement
			  			  
Additional Info		: This map is a modified version of "spine", the official
			  Qonference '98 1-on-1 tourney map. I added a couple
			  connections through two additional elevators, supplied
			  a new area and shifted a few items and DM starts around.
			  As a result the map is now better balanced, offers more
			  angles of attack and less opportunity to gain total control,
			  even in DMM1. Especially the 4 player FFA mode benefits a lot
 			  from that little extra ammo and health. Enjoy!
