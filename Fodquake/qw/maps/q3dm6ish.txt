Summary of the level
====================
Yup, another "ish", couldn't resist.

The map is very compact and open, even moreso than the original, and as a
consequence you can cover the map quite quickly which makes for intense games.
The map contains 1 of: QUAD/RA/YA/MH/RL/LG/GL/SNG, 2 SSG (close enough to
the original). The item balance is pretty good, and the RL isn't that campable,
but for maximum pleasure play in deathmatch mode 3.

Has fairly simplistic architecture (because the map is so open, r_speeds are already
too high, up to 700), and very contrasting lighting.

All textures (except the sky, wood, and the spawnpad) are my own, in the unlikely
event that you'd want to use them feel free to do so in any way you see fit. The
bricks you see are from bricks photographed around my house, other textures are
made from scratch, or from other base textures.

The "jumppads" are the closest approximation I could find but aren't infallible,
if you try tricks on them you fall back down. If you cut the arches very close
it is possible to get stuck on them, but this shouldn't happen in practice thanks
to some func_illusionary in the right places.

Thanks to my CyBear, Frib, Headshot, Zzjohnzz, Vondur, SleepwalkR and others that
gave feedback, sorry I ignored most of it. The first beta of this map had a more
conventional texture scheme, but Frib kept slagging off whatever I came up with,
so to take revenge I promised him I would come up with my own weirdo texture scheme.
So here it is Frib. Hope you cringe when you see it! ;)
