Summary of the level
====================
Don't know why, but I suddenly felt the urge to make a DM4 clone,
and I slapped this together in basically 1 day. It contains exactly
all items that DM4 contains, and in the corresponding same place.

Architecture: in general a lot roomier and plays smoother.

Connectivity: by changing the way corridors bend I was able to remove
all teleporters by simply joining the ends. This did change some of
the connectivity though as the RA "tele" now works 2 ways. Also I couldn't
resist making sure the RL/HH isn't a dead end anymore (you'll have to
pop your quad grenades in two directions now, sorry).

You now the drill: don't tamper with the archive or anything in it. Cheers.
Distribution in any way is ok. Hey, you could even ask me :)
