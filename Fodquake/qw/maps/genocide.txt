Place this map in your drive:\quake\id1\maps directory.

As you may of noticed this isn't xl1dm5.  This is Genocide.bsp.  Although its my
5th Quake I map, its not part of the XL1DM series on the simple fact this was an
expirement in level design in a sense.  Useing a open layout, and bright textures,
its a different map.  This map was never intended to be released, that was until
some people looked at it and told me to finish it.  This map was released to have fun
on, so please enjoy the map, and not be overly critical of it. :)
