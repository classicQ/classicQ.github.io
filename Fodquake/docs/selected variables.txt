cl_maxfps

	This variable sets the maximum limit for frames-per-second. 

net_maxfps

	Sets an upper limit on how many network frames (packets) Fodquake is allowed to send per second. 0 means as many as is allowed by the server. Defaults to 0.

pushlatency

	This variable is outdated and exists for compatibility with old configs.

rate

	Sets the maximum amount of bytes per second that the server should send to the client.

cl_c2spps

	Packet filtering (a la Qizmo's .c2spps command). Use this to reduce network traffic if you're playing on a 28800 (or worse) connection and can't set cl_maxfps 72 because it causes lag. Also consider use of FPS independent physics in conjunction with cl_physfps.

cl_c2simpulsebackup

	Used with cl_c2spps, it controls how many backup copies of packets with non-zero impulses are to be sent to the server.The recommended value is 3, but you can try 2 or even 1 to reduce traffic if you don't have any packet loss.
