Version 0.3
===========
- Fixed a problem in the handling of repeated keys on X11.
- Starting in window mode on X11 with mouse grab enabled and with automatic
  focusing of new windows disabled no longer results in an onfocused window
  you can't select.
- Fixed rcon to work again.
- Fixed a problem where movement would not work when joining a game after
  having tracked a player through Qizmo.
- Fixed a crash in the software renderer when displaying any of the 'low
  memory', 'low speed' or 'network lag' icons.
- Removed the obsolete m_side and m_forward cvars.
- Added support for client side lag via the net_lag and net_lag_ezcheat cvars.
- Removed the uglier than ugly r_shadows in GL.
- Changed the default volume from 0.7 to 0.5.
- gl_ztrick now defaults to 0.
- Brought the Win32 port up to date.
- Added DirectInput 8 support.
- Removed the cl_yawspeed and cl_pitchspeed cvars.
- Removed the force_centerview command.
- Linux USB mouse poll rate settings are checked and a warning is given if
  found to be lower than 500Hz.
- Made PNG the default screenshot format.
- v_damagecshift and v_kicktime now default to 0.
- Server browser entries can now be colour coded depending on their fullness.
- The maximum number of network frames per second can now be set via the
  net_maxfps cvar.
- The server browser now supports connecting directly to Eztv streams through
  a QTV proxy.
- New table layout code with optimal layout and entry sorting. Tab completion
  of commands and variables and other things presenting the output in a grid
  will use the new table layout code.
- The server browser now highlights the column used for sorting.
- Optimised dynamic lightmap rendering.
- Removed the last remnants of the obscurity module nonsense. As a result the
  'auth_validate', 'auth_viewcrc' and 'auth_warninvalid' cvars and the
  'validate_clients' command have been removed.
- Completely removed the Quake hunk memory system. The command line arguments
  '-minmemory', '-heapsize' and '­mem' are now obsolete and have been removed.
- Added context sensitive tab completion. Many commands (such as cfg_load,
  playdemo, alias, etc) now have special tab completion functionality.
- Rewrote the console handling code. It now uses less memory, can handle
  markups (such as colours) and context are relayout on console size change.
- Removed the gl_affinemodels cvar.
- Added cl_weaponfire and cl_weaponswitch cvars, used in combination with the
  also added +weapon command.
- Removed the sys_extrasleep cvar which has been obsolete since Fodquake 0.1.

Version 0.2
===========
- Rewrote the QW networking code.
- New ruleset code including EQL support.

Version 0.1 (since Fuhquake 0.31)
=================================
- Rewrote build system. It no longer sucks.
- Support for big endian systems.
- Support for 64 bit systems.
- Support for MorphOS.
- Support for FreeBSD.
- Support for NetBSD.
- Support for Nintendo Wii.
- Support for IPv6.
- Many fixes to the X11 support, including fullscreen support.
- GLX and X11 now share the same mouse code, which has had many improvements.
- Clipboard support for X11.
- Support for building Win32 target with MinGW.
- Non-platform specific code (lots of software rendering logic, mouse
  acceleration handling, etc...) has been moved out from the platform
  specific files where the code was previously duplicated before.
- FTE-compatible support for compression of network data.
- Command line arguments are no longer needed. Every option can be set by
  regular Quake cvars. Command line options are converted into their
  respective cvars for legacy reasons.
- Sound system parameters can be changed while Quake is running and sound can
  be completely turned on/off as well without a restart.
- Fixed several security issues.
- General code clean up. Now uses fewer globals, especially doesnn't use
  globals for argument passing.
- Console ctrl+pageup/pagedown scrolling fixed to scroll the correct amount of
  lines in all cases. That means always having one line from the previous page
  visible.
- Fixed an issue with small s_mixahead values and long QW uptimes.
- No longer consumes 100% CPU time when much less is actually required.
- Fixed GLX support for smart drivers and graphics hardware which isn't fast
  enough.
- Fixed various issues with displays that don't have a 4:3 ratio.
- Added support for FTE chunked downloads. Downloads can be much faster now on
  compatible servers.

  Z_EXT_PM_TYPE/Z_EXT_PM_TYPE_NEW.
- Added scr_scoreboard_titleseperator, set to 1 draws the original QW
  scoreboard title seperator.
- No longer lets broken mods (hint: they start with the letters 'kt') change
  the rate cvar. If the server asks for the cvar to be changed, only the
  userinfo will be changed, and the value will be restored when disconneting
  from the server.
- '%%' can now be used to output a literal '%' in chat strings.
- Removed the 'lookstrafe', 'lookspring', 'freelook', 'v_centermove',
  'v_centerspeed', 'cl_anglespeedkey' and 'cl_movespeedkey' cvars and the
  '+mlook', '-mlook', '+klook', '-klook', '+speed', '-speed', '+strafe',
  '-strafe' and 'centerview' commands.
